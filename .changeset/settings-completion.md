Wire the Profile, Authorized apps, and Danger zone tabs to real backends and add the supporting endpoints. The server gains `/me/apps` (list + revoke), `/me/export` (versioned ZIP), `/me/delete` (password + email gated, FK cascade), and email-aware Better Auth config that targets the old address for change-email confirmation. The client tabs replace their mocks with real queries/mutations, including a verification banner with 60s resend cooldown and a delete dialog that refuses to submit until both inputs validate.

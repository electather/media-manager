Add a new `x-plugin-resolved: true` JSON Schema extension for `userConfigSchema` properties that the plugin owns and the user must never submit. On incoming client payloads, `createFormConnection` and `updateUserConfig` strip these keys _before_ the payload reaches `startAuth` or the persisted row — the plugin repopulates them through `userConfigPatch`. A hostile client cannot impersonate another account by spoofing e.g. Jellyfin's `userId`. The frontend hides `x-plugin-resolved` fields from the create form entirely and renders them disabled on the edit form so users can see what the plugin resolved. Composes with standard JSON Schema `readOnly: true` (display-only hint) — `x-plugin-resolved` adds the server-side stripping on top.

Applied to Jellyfin's `userId` userConfig field (version bumped to 1.0.1).
